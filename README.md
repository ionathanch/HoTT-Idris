# HoTT in Idris

This repository will contain a formalization of some of the content in the Homotopy Type Theory textbook in Idris.
Of course, univalence is inconsistent with the brand of pattern-matching that Idris has (which implies the uniqueness of identity proofs, axiom K, etc.), so we will have to be careful never to match on `Refl`.

## Bonus content
* PLFI: [Programming Language Foundations in Agda](https://plfa.github.io/), but in Idris. This only contains some of the sections I find interesting.
